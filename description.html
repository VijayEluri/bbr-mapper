<h2>Autonomous 2-D Mapping of a Building Floor</h2>
by Constantin Berzan &amp; Andy Sayler
<br/><br/>
<h4>Objective:</h4>
We aim to program a robot that purposefully navigates a building and uses laser
and vision data to create a 2D map of the floor.  This involves exploring all
open space, and working around obstacles.  Additionally, we aim for our robot to
be able to localize itself within the mapped building, i.e. figure out where it
is based on its surroundings.
<h4>Summary:</h4>
&lt;short project summary including how this project uses
behavior-based techniques&gt;<br>
<h4>Final demonstration:</h4>
The demo will happen in Halligan Hall, first floor.
<ul>
    <li>We will place a brain-washed robot somewhere on the floor, and it will
    start exploring.  It will navigate all available open areas without bumping
    into obstacles.  When done, it will produce an image representation of the
    map it has constructed.</li>
    <li>After the map has been created, we will turn off the robot and move it
    to a specific room. We will then turn it on and let it figure out where it
    is. It will draw its inferred location on the image representation of the
    map.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Robot platform:</h4>
Videre platform equipped with lasers and camera.
<h4>Team responsibilities (only for teams &gt;1):</h4>
&lt;list each team member's responsibilities&gt;<br>
<h4>Relevant literature:</h4>
&lt;any literature you found relevant which you will consult for the
project&gt;<br>
<h4>Milestones:</h4>
&lt;give a list of milestones for the project with a rough timeline for
the period from 10/14 through 12/07&gt;<br>
