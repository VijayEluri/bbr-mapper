\begin{abstract}
This week we completed a review of the SLAM literature and refined the scope of our
project.

\section{Introduction}



\section{Project Summary}

We will be developing our robot using a schema (or possibly hybrid)
architecture. The robot will utilize schema based functions to manifest the
following behaviors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid obstacles
    \item Avoid local minima
    \item Seek new areas
    \item Utilize SLAM (laser + odometry) to deduce current location
    \item Utilize SLAM (laser + odometry) to generate persistent environmental map
\end{itemize}

We will utilize the ADE robotics environment to complete our implementation.
The first objective will be to create code capable of navigating our robot
through unfamiliar environments and exploring these environments to their full
potential without getting stuck or colliding with obstacles. 

The next goal will be to build a map of the environment and provide
localization abilities. This will be done by implementing a basic SLAM system
using laser and odomtery data from scratch.  We aim to develop a 2D floor plan
map using data from our SLAM system.

Should we complete the initial scope of this project ahead of schedule, we may
opt to pursue one or more of the following extensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilize vision data in SLAM system
    \item Utilize vision data in 2D map generation
    \item Compare performance of our SLAM system to Carmen
    \item Augment SLAM system with additional sensor packages (radio ranging,
          etc)
\end{itemize}


\section{Problems tackled}

Literature review:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SLAM for Dummies tutorial -- both
    \item Carmen -- Andy
    \item Vision-based SLAM -- Constantin
\end{itemize}

Discussed and refined project scope:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Opted to implement SLAM ourselves
    \item Decided to use SLAM data as primary source for persistent 2D map data
\end{itemize}


\section{Next Steps}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Review ADE architecture for optimal design and workflow
    \item Build simple map of Halligan for the simulator
    \item Determine metrics of Videre base (laser range, odometry accuracy, etc)
    \item Review Kalman filtering technique
\end{itemize}
