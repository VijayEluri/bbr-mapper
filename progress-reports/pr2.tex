\title{BBR Progress Report 002:\\ Autonomous 2-D Mapping of a Building Floor}
\author{Andy Sayler \& Constantin Berzan}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This week we continued our review of SLAM literature and developed a plan
for measuring the accuracy of the odometry data on the Videre platform. We
also began a review of Kalman filtering techniques and developed a system
to create simulated environments from svg graphics.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
SLAM is the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using a mobile
robot.  We aim to develop a proof-of-concept SLAM system adhering to the
behavior-based philosophy.  The robot will use odometry and laser range data to
navigate the first floor of Halligan, and produce an image representation of
the floor map.


\section{Project Summary}

We will be developing our robot using a schema (or possibly hybrid)
architecture. The robot will utilize schema based functions to manifest the
following behaviors:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
    \item Avoid obstacles
    \item Avoid local minima
    \item Seek new areas
    \item Utilize SLAM (laser + odometry) to deduce current location
    \item Utilize SLAM (laser + odometry) to generate persistent environmental
          map
\end{itemize}

We will utilize the ADE robotics environment to complete our implementation.
The first objective will be to create code capable of navigating our robot
through unfamiliar environments and exploring these environments to their full
potential without getting stuck or colliding with obstacles. 

The next goal will be to build a map of the environment and provide
localization abilities. This will be done by implementing a basic SLAM
system using laser and odomtery data.  We aim to develop a 2D floor plan map
using data from our SLAM system.\\

Should we complete the initial scope of this project ahead of schedule, we may
opt to pursue one or more of the following extensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
    \item Utilize vision data in SLAM system
    \item Utilize vision data in 2D map generation
    \item Compare performance of our SLAM system to Carmen
    \item Augment SLAM system with additional sensor packages (radio ranging,
          etc)
\end{itemize}

    \item Carmen -- Andy
    \item Vision-based SLAM -- Constantin
\end{itemize}

\noindent{Discussed and refined project scope:}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
    \item Opted to implement SLAM ourselves
    \item Decided to use SLAM data as primary source for persistent 2D map data

\noindent{Discussed Odometry Testing Setup:}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
    \item Linear Distance Testing (i.e. Drive 10m, then measure actual
      distance and angle)
    \item Start/Stop Testing (i.e. drive 1m in 10cm steps issuing
      start and stop commands between each step to measure start/stop drift)
    \item Rotational Distance Testing (i.e. Turn 180 degrees, then measure
      actual angle.)
    \item Acceleration Test (i.e. drive 10m and use internal timer to log
      distance at each tenth second interval to compute robot dynamics)
