project.

reset-videre-odometry.patch - Make a public (remotely-callable) resetOdometry()
                              function in VidereServer that resets the odometry
                              by calling the internal COMorigin() function.

public-beacons.patch - Makes the getBeaconData() function public in
                       ActionServer.

adesim-getbeacons-hack.patch - HACK: wrap getBeaconData() call in try/catch
                               block, caused by public-beacons.patch.
