This directory contains modifications to ADE that we performed as part of this
project.

sim-odom-noise.patch - Add a function getNoisyPoseEgo() to ADESimActorServer and
                       SimLocationSpecifier, so that we have a source of noisy
                       odometry data for our EKF. Unfortunately, the simulator
                       relies on having accurate getPoseEgo(), so we cannot add
                       noise to the odometry data that is kept for that.
                       The noise is Gaussian and scaled by the true dx, dy,
                       dtheta. This is probably a poor model for the real world.

reset-videre-odometry.patch - Make a public (remotely-callable) resetOdometry()
                              function in VidereServer that resets the odometry
                              by calling the internal COMorigin() function.

public-beacons.patch - Makes the getBeaconData() function public in
                       ActionServer.

adesim-getbeacons-hack.patch - HACK: wrap getBeaconData() call in try/catch
                               block, caused by public-beacons.patch.

ransac-vis.patch - HACK: modify LRFServer vis to enable visualization of RANSAC
                   results.
