svg2cfg.py
-------------
A script to extract all rectangles from a SVG and generate an XML map for
ADESim2010. Uses the size of the SVG drawing as the limits of the world. Makes
it easy to draw maps in Inkscape, then use them in the simulator.

TODO
-------
* Fix coordinates: Inkscape and simulator use different origins (upside-down)
* Warn user if coordinates of map are too large
