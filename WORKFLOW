This document describes the recommended setup for integrating this code with
ADE.

ADE and the code for this project live in separate directories.
ADE lives in ADE_DIR (~/src/ade/dist in my case). It is checked out with
svn --username bbr10 co svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/trunk/ ade

This project lives at BBRMAPPER_DIR (~/.../bbr-mapper in my case). It is checked
out from github. The project contains a bunch of scripts and data, which are
independent of ADE. It will also contain ADE components, such as the ArchImpl
for the odometry tests, and the actual SLAM implementation. Suppose that one
such component is called odometry, and lives in BBRMAPPER_DIR/odometry.
Everything in the odometry component must be in the com.odometry Java package.
To use this component with ADE, create a symlink of it in ADE_DIR/com:
cd ADE_DIR/com
ln -s BBRMAPPER_DIR/odometry .

This way the SVN checkout of ADE and the Git checkout of this code are kept
separate.
